# MCTS-ML-Game

Usage of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a Decision Tree (DT) for the playout policy in the
Othello board game.

This repository is structured as follows:

- data/: a directory containing data collected from different executions of the MCTS algorithm.
- code/: contains the MCTS algorithm used as well as the code for collecting data from it.

This project is currently being developed. This README will be updated when a fully functional
version of MCTS using DTs is implemented and tested.
